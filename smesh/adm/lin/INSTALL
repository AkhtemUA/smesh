LINUX/MACOSX installation manual

Requirements: to safely build salomesmesh library, you need:
- a proper OpenCASCADE 6.3.0 installation,
- boost headers,
- a fortran77 compiler

Note for MacOSX users: the best way to install a fortran 77 compiler is to use f77/f2c.
To download/build/install f77:
from the High Performance Computing for MacOSX website (http://hpc.sourceforge.net), download the buildf2c.sh script. It can be directly accessed here:
http://hpc.sourceforge.net/buildf2c
then:
sh buildf2c

Before starting the build process, you have to ensure that the boost headers will be found by the configure script. If boost does not reside in /usr/include or /usr/local/include, you have to set the CPPFLAGS env vrar:
export CPPFLAGS=-I/your_boost_include_path:$CPPFLAGS

Build/Install:
cd adm/lin
autoreconf --install
./configure
make
make install
